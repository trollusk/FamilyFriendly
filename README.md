This is a mod for Conan Exiles by Funcom. 

Conan Exiles is an excellent survival game. It is quite similar to Valheim but with better graphics and much more content. 
However, it is rated 18+ in most countries because of very significant adult content including:
- Optional full nudity, and sliders to increase breast and penis size during character creation
- Blood, gore, dismemberment and decapitation during combat
- Depictions of cannibalism, and the ability to butcher and eat human corpses
- A major game system where players obtain workers by kidnapping and enslaving human NPCs
- A few female outfits that would be at home in a Cardi B video
- A few instances of rude words in item descriptions and NPC dialogue.
- Alcoholic beverages that cause the player to become "drunk" if consumed to excess

This mod attempts to make the game more suitable for older children and younger teens, by patching out or altering
most of this content. It is not perfect, and I am not responsible for any harm you may cause to your child by letting them play an 18+ game.

The features of the mod are listed below.

### Character creation:

* No sliders for breasts or male "endowment" in character creation.
* No nudity level selection in character creation.
* No random crime list at the end of character creation.
* The "evil" religions are unavailable at character creation (Set, Derketo, Yog, Zath).

### Gore and cannibalism:

* When players and human NPCs die, instead of creating a corpse they disappear in a puff of purple smoke and drop a loot bag.
* Players cannot harvest human flesh or body parts from human corpses.
* For the religions of Ymir, Mitra and Jhebbal Sag, no longer get religious "essences" from human corpses. Instead the source varies per religion:
  * **Ymir**: ice and black ice resource nodes, and corpses of ice rocknoses, frost giants and yeti.
  * **Mitra**: corpses of undead.
  * **Jhebbal Sag**: corpses of powerful predators (eg tigers, lions, wolves, bears) and werecreatures.

### Other in-game effects:

* Cannot learn feats or recipes for wheel of pain or other slavery-related items.
* The "evil" religions are not taught by any NPCs.
* For some overly revealing pieces of female chest armour, switched the models so they have the same appearance as other less revealing ones.
* Removed swear words and sexual content from item descriptions and NPC dialogue texts. (English only). The associated sound files have been replaced with silence.
* Alcoholic beverages no longer cause drunkenness.

### Things I have not changed:

* Gore, dismemberment and decapitation - there are already mods for this, such as "Dismember Me Not".
* There is an upcoming major game patch (3.0) which will introduce Sorcery into the game. This will introduce more adult content such as human sacrifice. 
  The mod currently does not address Sorcery changes in any way.
* A less evil alternative method of recruiting thralls. Isle of Siptah has captive thralls who you can free from cages, but unfortunately Funcom has not 
  made this system accessible in the Devkit. You can still recruit thralls by rescuing them if you play the Isle of Siptah DLC with this mod.
